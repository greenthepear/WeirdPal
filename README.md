**WeirdPal** is a web app for writing parody songs.

It shows the original and parody lines right next to each other and counts the syllables, all to make matching the flow and *prosody~* easier for you.

Made with **[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)** because Elm is cool. 

# Build

    $ elm make src/Main.elm --output public/index.js

(or just run `make.sh` that has optimizations)

Open `public/index.html`.

# License
Under GPL-3.0 license, but that only goes for the software itself. Any song you make with this is all yours, but credit or a link to the website would be appreciated. üôè
